# 9.18.1 implementation

## Phase 1, slice 1: installed invariant read observations

Boundary review: retained snapshot projections already expose
`WorthQueryInvariantProjectionWork` through the host facade and its snapshot.
Installed rules instead use `WorthQueryApplicationInvariantReadView`, which
currently records no Query read observations. Relational continues to own
proposed-state access, declared access, prepared scope, interruption and commit
validation. Query observes its actual reads without granting additional access
or changing existing work budgets. Relation filtering happens after inspection;
discarded relation kinds must still count.

Adversarial constraint: repeated proposed/committed view construction, a filtered
edge or a failing field decode must not erase reads, manufacture a successful
evaluation or report a result-length estimate as work performed.

Plan:

1. Retain the existing public counter representation. Add observation storage
   under `application_invariant/read_observation.rs`, owned by each preparation
   or evaluation and borrowed by its read views. `planner.reads()` reports
   preparation; `context.reads()` includes that preparation and this evaluation.
2. Record adjacency acquisition, relation inspections, entity reads and field
   reads where they occur. Keep authority checks before reads and preserve all
   existing denial behavior. Extract field access from the existing oversized
   typed-view file into its own child responsibility.
3. Exercise observations through the existing real commit-boundary rule fixture,
   including preparation, repeated views, domain refusal and cancellation.
   Expose the common type in the invariant facade for compiled callers.
4. Run focused owner tests, formatting, dirty line caps/function inspection,
   boundary-check and agent-context. The persistent reviewer reviews the living
   diff and results before the slice commit.

No new budgets, admission accounting, evaluation engine or raw application
handles. Declared-query receipt unification, planar equality/growth evidence,
the full public guide and Proprietary adoption follow in subsequent Phase 1
slices. The phase cannot merge to master before those obligations close.

The next slice also separates snapshot projection endpoint reservations from
actual endpoint reads. Existing `traversal.rs` records reserved result capacity
before acquiring endpoints; the new installed-rule observations count acquired
metadata. Preserve the existing projection budget accounting while repairing
that observation boundary. This is a known Phase 1 obligation, not a claim that
the two existing paths already measure the same thing.

Interpretation: replace the specification's exact count golden with equivalent
read equality and meaningful locality/growth checks. MENTALITY section 7 and
the performance laws explicitly reject exact counts as performance contracts.
Counts describe reads, not a promise that lawful implementation changes preserve
an incidental number.

## Phase 1, slice 2: snapshot endpoint observations

Boundary review: snapshot traversal and body collection record native endpoint
reservation counts before acquiring endpoint metadata. Aggregate scans also
pass reservation counts to the same observation method despite performing no
separate endpoint lookup. Decision adjacency facts derive their recomparison
allowance from these public observations. Native adjacency reads, the existing
private projection budget and retained decision facts keep their authority.

Adversarial constraint: a native adjacency scan may reserve records and stop
before any endpoint lookup. A later endpoint read may acquire metadata and
reject its kind. Observations must distinguish those cases without changing
which ordinary reads or decision rechecks fit the existing budget.

Plan:

1. Remove the endpoint-reservation argument from `record_adjacency`, including
   aggregate and body-collection callers. Keep native budget consumption as is.
2. Record endpoint metadata only inside the native `endpoint` acquisition
   callback. Count acquired but invalid metadata; count nothing when no callback
   ran. Remove the body-collection anchor's duplicate pre-recording.
3. Move adjacency recomparison demand to the private budget's consumed-work
   delta, preserving its extra final check and minimum allowance. Public read
   observations no longer select that allowance.
4. Add real snapshot tests for partial scans, endpoint rejection and pre-read
   cancellation; retain the lawful counterpart. Exercise existing decision
   adjacency/currentness, body requirements and aggregate tests, plus the
   affected grouped public certification families. Check formatting, dirty
   composition/size/function advisories, boundary-check and agent-context.
5. The persistent reviewer checks the living patch and final results before
   this slice's commit. No master merge until all Phase 1 work is complete.

Destination topology stays under `invariant_projection`: `traversal` owns
endpoint observations, `work` owns the existing private budget, and aggregate
accounting consumes native charges without inventing endpoint observations.
Tests stay at their owning operation. No additional budget, traversal engine,
public metric type or exported test door is introduced.

Snapshot field preflight observations, declared receipt unification, public
examples/differentials and Proprietary adoption remain later Phase 1 work.
Managed computation range carriage also copies historical read observations
into a current run (`computation_calls/ranges.rs`). The shared observation slice
must keep actual read observations separate from the existing private carried
budget charges; historic reads must not masquerade as current acquisitions.

## Phase 1, slice 3: shared actual-read observations

Boundary review: field projections and aggregates record field admission before
native acquisition. Managed call charges retain diagnostic read counts, replay
them on reuse and rewind them on fallback. Their private demand/consumption
already carry the genuine budget contract independently. Declared query
receipts expose native adjacency observations but call preflight projection
capacity a field count. Native frontier guards scan records, not indexes;
they need acquisition-site field observations, not an inferred index count.

Adversarial constraint: reuse must not claim historical reads happened again;
fallback must not erase reads already performed. Optional absence and decoding
failure still read a field, whereas a refused acquisition does not. A new
receipt observable must preserve existing disclosure noninterference in every
receipt lane.

Plan:

1. Move the existing public observation type to the primary graph's shared
   `read_observation` owner, preserving its facade export. Keep the private
   projection budget in `invariant_projection/work`. Remove diagnostic data
   from managed call charge/start/summary state; preserve private charge,
   scope and fact carriage. Restart only the private budget, not observations.
2. Count snapshot/predecode/aggregate fields at native acquisition, including
   absent optional values and failed decoding. Retain original budget admission
   and native request controls. Add actual field observations to both native
   frontier guard implementations without changing their work charges.
3. Carry actual root/tree reads through RawOneShotRows and all receipt
   constructors: one-shot, continuation and live refresh. Expose `reads()` using
   the common type; migrate obsolete adjacency aliases to its canonical names.
   Preserve authorization and non-read work evidence independently.
4. Extend the existing disclosure receipt comparison, real managed reuse and
   fallback tests, and field/receipt regressions. Run focused owner evidence and
   affected grouped public targets, formatting, dirty structural checks,
   boundary-check and agent-context. The persistent reviewer gates the living
   patch and final results before commit.

No additional budget, public counter type, observation-based admission or view
engine. Public compiled planar examples, the feature guide and Proprietary
adoption still gate Phase 1 closure and its merge to master.

## Phase 1, slice 4: public planar evidence and read guide

Boundary review: the installed PositiveTurnRule prepares predecessor discovery
and then two outgoing successor hops per distinct affected root. Evaluation
reads coordinates from those prepared triples. PlanarQuery reads two outgoing
successor hops from its named root. Their whole counts describe different work;
only the same-root forward interval is an equivalent adjacency read. Installed
context observations include preparation, and survive ordinary domain refusal.
Retained snapshot projection readers are a separate public host read surface.

The existing TopologyConfiguration -> setup.invariant -> resolve_rule path can
carry an optional application-owned observer. Event envelopes hold the shared
Work snapshots and genuine EntityId, not a second counter or access authority.
Bootstrap also invokes rules, so the example clears its seed observations and
correlates one explicit edit's directly touched body before comparing reads.

Plan:

1. Add the optional ordinary observer to the topology configuration; existing
   callers supply None. Split the touched planar invariant into binding/trait,
   preparation and evaluation responsibilities. Record raw preparation,
   forward-hop and evaluation snapshots at their actual boundaries, including
   preparation/evaluation errors and ordinary violations. Never select a verdict
   from observations or derive counts from PLANAR_CHECKED_WORK.
2. Add a runnable `invariant_reads` example using the existing required-feature
   program and installation. Parameterize that seed's unrelated ring population
   while preserving its default. Compare a single touched root's actual forward
   interval with the ordinary PlanarRead receipt, then compare full observations
   across increasing unrelated rings. Exercise domain refusal and unchanged
   committed reads. Retain the original request and invariant budgets.
3. Write `foundations/invariants-and-read-observations.md` using the real public
   facades: installed proposed/committed rules, retained projections, decision
   reads, and ordinary declared receipts. Include methods, access/denial and
   lifecycle limits, small and realistic examples, and the shared counter units.
   Bind the realistic snippet to compiled source through the existing consumer
   documentation inventory/drift court; update capability/guide navigation.
4. Build/run the new example and existing required-feature tests, the compiled
   snippet drift court and affected public invariant acceptance consumers. Run
   formatting, dirty size/function/composition review, boundary-check and
   agent-context. The persistent reviewer gates the living patch and evidence
   before this slice's commit.

Proprietary adoption remains the next Phase 1 obligation. No master merge until
all Phase 1 requirements are proven; no new budget, platform test door, traversal
engine or observation-based production decision in this slice.
